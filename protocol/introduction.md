# What is Hifi?

Hifi is a decentralized finance protocol that brings fixed-rate, fixed-term lending to Ethereum-based blockchains.

This documentation will walk you through the core concepts of Hifi and show you how to integrate the protocol in your
own project. These are the main areas that we will cover:

1. Protocol overview, governance and security.
2. Guides for users and developers.
3. Technical references for our smart contracts.

Let's dive right in.
