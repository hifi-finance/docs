# Governance

Hifi Governance and ERC-20 token implementation are each based on a common foundation stemming from Compound's GovernorBravo Smart Contracts. To meet our requirements we are pulling our ERC-20 token implementation from Uniswap's fork of Compound Governance, and pulling the Governance smart contracts from Ampleforth's fork of Compound Governance.

We chose Uniswap for the token implementation because it comes with the ERC-2612 functionality along with a governance based minting functionality we require. Uniswap's code for token implementation is in a direct fork from the Compound token implementation.

The foundation of our governance contracts came from the Ampleforth fork of GovernorBravo, because similar to us and unlike Uniswap or Compound, they did not have legacy GovernorAlpha smart contracts before their GovernorBravo implementation. All changes we have made on top of this fork are outlined in COMMITLOG.md. Briefly, those changes include updating the Solidity version, adding support for our token swap, and integrating our token requirements to the codebase.

## Modus Operandi

We believe that the best way to scale a decentralized finance protocol is via progressive decentralization. Hifi is ultimately a startup, and we have to deal with uncertainty when it comes to:

1. Product/ market fit
2. Smart contract security.

Because achieving both is no easy feat, we will not focus on decentralizing governance in the initial phase of the protocol.

### Product/ Market Fit

Being able to unilaterally make decisions about the smart contract code speeds up the development process and enables us to get to a point where users love our fixed-rate lending product.
The ephemeral nature of the hTokens permits us to make changes to their source code on the fly.

### Precautions

Smart contracts are powerful technology, but the fact that they are immutable once deployed brings risks. We hedge against these risks in the following ways:

1. We designed the [BalanceSheet](../technical-reference/core/balance-sheet.md)) contract to be upgradeable. This is
   the contract that holds all users' collateral deposits.
2. We enforced caps on how much debt can be taken on by borrowers.
3. We gave ourselves the ability to pause most operations (except for collateral withdrawals).

With time, the protocol will become more resilient and safe to use. We will subsequently change and remove these
precautions.
