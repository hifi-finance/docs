# Introduction

Welcome to the Hifi Finance governance documentation. Hifi Finance is a decentralized protocol managed by its community through the HIFI token. The governance process relies on three key components: the [HIFI token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4b9278b94a1112cAD404048903b8d343a810B07e#code), the governance module ([Governor Bravo](https://etherscan.io/address/0xef0A0421Ea43b602E5Be35e9018Dd3E34Bcee007#code)), and the [Timelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xAC46Db50B44BBeF8DC25f778359e1834248147F7). These elements work in harmony to enable the community to propose, vote on, and implement changes to the protocol.

Proposals can range from adjusting system parameters to adding support for new collateral or even introducing entirely new features. HIFI token holders have the option to delegate their voting rights to themselves or to any other address of their choosing. To create a governance proposal, an address must hold a minimum of 2,825 delegated HIFI tokens.

Upon the creation of a governance proposal, it enters a review period (with a maximum configurable duration of approximately one week). After this period, voting weights are registered, and the voting phase commences, lasting for three days. For a proposal to be approved, it must receive a majority vote and at least ~2,376,847 votes cast in its favor. Once approved, the proposal is queued in the Timelock and can be executed after a two-day waiting period. Consequently, any modifications to the protocol take a minimum of five days to be implemented.

This documentation aims to provide comprehensive guidance on Hifi Finance governance contracts, facilitating community involvement and promoting transparency in the decision-making process.
