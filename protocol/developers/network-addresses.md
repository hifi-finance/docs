# Network Addresses

Depending on what network you want to use Hifi on, you need to use a different set of contract addresses.
HTokens are rotated frequently because they each have a different expiration date. For brevity, we don't maintain addresses of hTokens. Reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mhtSRz6) if you need those addresses.

Ethereum is a like a blueprint. Multiple independent networks conform to this blueprint, without interacting directly with one another.
