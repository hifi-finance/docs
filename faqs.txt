# Frequently Asked Questions

## Protocol

Q: What is Hifi Protocol?
A: Hifi Protocol is a US-based decentralized lending protocol that enables fixed-rate, fixed-term borrowing using real-world assets and other ERC-20 tokens as collateral. We specialize in bringing real-world assets on-chain to serve as collateral.

Q: What assets can I use as collateral?
A: Currently supported collateral assets include:
- ETH (125% collateral ratio)
- VWMBp (125% collateral ratio) - Real-world asset token
- SHEETp (333% collateral ratio) - Real-world asset token
- CRE1p (125% collateral ratio) - Real-world asset token
- HC1 (167% collateral ratio) - Real-world asset token
- RCC1 (125% collateral ratio) - Real-world asset token

Q: How do collateral ratios work?
A: The collateral ratio represents the minimum amount of collateral value required relative to your borrowed amount. For example, with ETH's 125% ratio, you need at least $125 worth of ETH to borrow $100.

Q: What makes Hifi unique?
A: As a US-based protocol, Hifi distinguishes itself by focusing on bringing real-world assets on-chain as collateral, making DeFi more accessible to traditional finance while maintaining regulatory compliance.

## Governance

Q: How is Hifi Protocol governed?
A: Hifi Protocol utilizes decentralized governance where token holders can propose and vote on protocol changes and improvements.

Q: How can I participate in governance?
A: Token holders can participate by creating proposals, voting on active proposals, and joining governance discussions in the community Discord server.

## Hifi DAO

Q: What is Hifi DAO?
A: Hifi DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is the governing body of the Hifi Protocol, composed of token holders who collectively make decisions about protocol development and management.

Q: How are DAO decisions made?
A: Decisions are made through a democratic voting process where token holders can submit proposals and vote on changes to the protocol.

## Security

Q: How secure is Hifi Protocol?
A: Hifi Protocol prioritizes security through:
- Smart contract audits
- Bug bounty programs
- Conservative collateral ratios
- Transparent protocol operations
- Compliance with US regulations and standards

Q: What happens if my collateral value drops?
A: If your collateral value drops below the required ratio, your position may be liquidated to protect the protocol and other users. It's important to maintain a healthy collateral ratio above the minimum requirement.

Q: How can I ensure the safety of my assets?
A: To protect your assets:
- Monitor your collateral ratio regularly
- Maintain a buffer above minimum requirements
- Use official interfaces and contracts
- Never share private keys or seed phrases
- Verify you're interacting with official Hifi Protocol contracts
